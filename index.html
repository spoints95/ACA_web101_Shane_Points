            <p>As someone that finds fascination in how things work I started working on cars and it is still a major hobby I have today! Around the age of 18, when I was introduced to building computers by my father, I became interested in the tech world.
              I started by building my own gaming PCs. After years of tinkering with engines and PCs in my spare time, I found something i was truly amazed by. Coding. After playing around in some of the free teaching softwares i found, I decided to take a leap 
              and enroll in Austion Coding Academy. Through these courses I am looking to gain knowledge and basics of the common languages used today. And with that knowledge, continue to grow
              as a developer and push my boundaries in a career that continues to evolve and reach new heights.</p>
