              <p>As someone that finds fascination in how things work, I started working on cars which is still a major hobby I have today! Around the age of 18,
                 my father introduced me to building computers. I then became interested in the tech world and started by building my own gaming PCs. After years
                 of tinkering with engines and PCs in my spare time, I found something I was truly amazed by. Coding. After playing around in some of the free 
                 teaching software programs, I decided to take a leap and enroll in Austin Coding Academy. Through these courses I am looking to gain knowledge 
                 and basics of the common languages used today. With that knowledge, I plan to continue to grow as a developer and push my boundaries in a career 
                 that continues to evolve and reach new heights.</p>
